# C Practice

This is a collection of practice programs I created in C to demonstrate different uses and scenarios. Each file is its own program individually.

## Backend:
- C v.C17
- `.txt` databases

## Tools:
- Git and GitHub for version control
- Replit for web-based editing
- Visual Studio Code for local editing
